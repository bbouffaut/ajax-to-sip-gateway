# README #

This project aims at implementing a **WebApp to SIP gateway** in order to
access SIP services from any web browser. It has been issued in 2009 and is based on Google Web Toolkit framework for the client part. 

**NB**: this project is not maintained anymore since it is based on a old-fashioned AJAX polling approach.***It should be rewritten to use WebRTC current technologies***. However, most of the logic would be re-usable in WebRTC context.
